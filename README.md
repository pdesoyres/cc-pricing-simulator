# Pricing simulator 

This project tries to implement a pricing simulator as shown in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-E0gJHZG7k

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

You can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
